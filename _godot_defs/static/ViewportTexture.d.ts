/**
 * A [ViewportTexture] provides the content of a [Viewport] as a dynamic [Texture2D]. This can be used to combine the rendering of [Control], [Node2D] and [Node3D] nodes. For example, you can use this texture to display a 3D scene inside a [TextureRect], or a 2D overlay in a [Sprite3D].
 *
 * To get a [ViewportTexture] in code, use the [method Viewport.get_texture] method on the target viewport.
 *
 * **Note:** A [ViewportTexture] is always local to its scene (see [member Resource.resource_local_to_scene]). If the scene root is not ready, it may return incorrect data (see [signal Node.ready]).
 *
 * **Note:** Instantiating scenes containing a high-resolution [ViewportTexture] may cause noticeable stutter.
 *
 * **Note:** When using a [Viewport] with [member Viewport.use_hdr_2d] set to `true`, the returned texture will be an HDR image that uses linear encoding. This may look darker than normal when displayed directly on screen. To convert to nonlinear sRGB encoding, you can do the following:
 *
 * @example
 *
 * img.convert(Image.FORMAT_RGBA8)
 * img.linear_to_srgb()
 * @summary
 *
 *
 * **Note:** Some nodes such as [Decal], [Light3D], and [PointLight2D] do not support using [ViewportTexture] directly. To use texture data from a [ViewportTexture] in these nodes, you need to create an [ImageTexture] by calling [method Texture2D.get_image] on the [ViewportTexture] and passing the result to [method ImageTexture.create_from_image]. This conversion is a slow operation, so it should not be performed every frame.
