/**
 * A Spotlight is a type of [Light3D] node that emits lights in a specific direction, in the shape of a cone. The light is attenuated through the distance. This attenuation can be configured by changing the energy, radius and attenuation parameters of [Light3D].
 *
 * Light is emitted in the -Z direction of the node's global basis. For an unrotated light, this means that the light is emitted forwards, illuminating the front side of a 3D model (see [constant Vector3.FORWARD] and [constant Vector3.MODEL_FRONT]).
 *
 * **Note:** When using the Mobile rendering method, only 8 spot lights can be displayed on each mesh resource. Attempting to display more than 8 spot lights on a single mesh resource will result in spot lights flickering in and out as the camera moves. When using the Compatibility rendering method, only 8 spot lights can be displayed on each mesh resource by default, but this can be increased by adjusting [member ProjectSettings.rendering/limits/opengl/max_lights_per_object].
 *
 * **Note:** When using the Mobile or Compatibility rendering methods, spot lights will only correctly affect meshes whose visibility AABB intersects with the light's AABB. If using a shader to deform the mesh in a way that makes it go outside its AABB, [member GeometryInstance3D.extra_cull_margin] must be increased on the mesh. Otherwise, the light may not be visible on the mesh.
