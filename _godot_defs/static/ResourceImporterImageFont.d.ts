   * The character ranges to import from the font image. This is an array that maps each position on the image (in tile coordinates, not pixels). The font atlas is traversed from left to right and top to bottom. Characters can be specified with decimal numbers (126), hexadecimal numbers (`0x007e` or `U+007e`), or between single quotes (`'~'`). Ranges can be specified with a hyphen between characters.
   *
   * For example, `0-127` represents the full ASCII range. It can also be written as `0x0000-0x007f` (or `U+0000-U+007f`). As another example, `' '-'~'` is equivalent to `32-126` and represents the range of printable (visible) ASCII characters.
   *
   * For any range, the character advance and offset can be customized by appending three space-separated integer values (additional advance, x offset, y offset) to the end. For example `'a'-'b' 4 5 2` sets the advance to `char_width + 4` and offset to `Vector2(5, 2)` for both `a` and `b` characters.
   *
   * **Note:** The overall number of characters must not exceed the number of [member columns] multiplied by [member rows]. Otherwise, the font will fail to import.
