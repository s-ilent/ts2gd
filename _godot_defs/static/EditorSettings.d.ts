   * Adds a [param shortcut] whose path is specified by [param path].

   * The [param path] determines how the shortcut is organized and displayed in the editor's shortcut settings. The path format affects the display as follows:
   *
   * - `"name"` (no slash): Creates a category named `name` with the shortcut displayed as `name`.
   *
   * - `"category/name"` (single slash): Displays as `name` in the `category` section.
   *
   * - `"category/name/extra"` (multiple slashes): Extra path components are ignored, so this behaves the same as `"category/name"`.
