   *
   * If [member ProjectSettings.display/window/vsync/vsync_mode] is **Enabled** or **Adaptive**, the setting takes precedence and the max FPS number cannot exceed the monitor's refresh rate. See also [method DisplayServer.screen_get_refresh_rate].

At higher refresh rates, the difference between the FPS limit and the monitor refresh rate should be increased to ensure frames to account for timing inaccuracies. The optimal formula for the FPS limit value in this scenario is `r - (r * r) / 3600.0`, where `r` is the monitor's refresh rate.
   *
   * **Note:** The actual number of frames per second may still be below this value if the CPU or GPU cannot keep up with the project's logic and rendering.
   *
   * **Note:** If [member ProjectSettings.display/window/vsync/vsync_mode] is **Disabled**, limiting the FPS to a high value that can be consistently reached on the system can reduce input lag compared to an uncapped framerate. Since this works by ensuring the GPU load is lower than 100%, this latency reduction is only effective in GPU-bottlenecked scenarios, not CPU-bottlenecked scenarios.
